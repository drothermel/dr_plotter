# Faceted Plotting Implementation Plan

## Overview
Build systematic support for complex multi-dimensional data visualization with faceted subplots, using a dataset that varies across model sizes, data recipes, metrics, and training steps.

**Target Visualization**: 2-row × N-column grid where rows represent different metrics, columns represent data recipes, and each subplot contains multiple lines (one per model size).

## Systematic Process

### Phase 1: Analysis & Data Understanding
**Objective**: Understand data structure and constraints before building

**Deliverables**:
- Data exploration script in `scripts/explore_mean_eval_data.py`
- Complete understanding of available dimensions and constraints
- Clear mapping of data structure to plotting requirements

**Success Criteria**:
- Can programmatically extract all available metrics, data recipes, model sizes
- Understand data completeness and any missing combinations
- Have functions ready to subset and prepare data for plotting

### Phase 2: Example Implementation
**Objective**: Build target visualization using current dr_plotter capabilities

**Deliverables**:
- Working example in `examples/` that produces desired visualization
- Documentation of all configuration required
- List of friction points and repetitive patterns

**Success Criteria**:
- Example produces publication-ready visualization
- All configuration is explicit and understandable
- Clear identification of what should be abstracted

### Phase 3: Library Enhancement Design  
**Objective**: Design faceting API that reduces boilerplate while maintaining flexibility

**Design Decisions**:
- Natural boundary between dr_plotter and user code
- Configuration patterns that feel intuitive
- Reusable patterns vs. domain-specific logic

**Deliverables**:
- API design document
- Clear separation of concerns
- Backwards compatibility strategy

### Phase 4: Implementation & Validation
**Objective**: Implement faceting enhancements and validate improved usability

**Deliverables**:
- Enhanced dr_plotter with faceting support
- Refactored example using new API
- Performance and usability validation

**Success Criteria**:
- New API reduces example boilerplate significantly
- Enhanced library maintains all existing functionality
- Example demonstrates improved ease of use

## Key Architectural Questions

1. **Scope Boundary**: How much faceting logic belongs in dr_plotter vs. user code?
2. **Configuration Pattern**: What's the most intuitive way to specify grid layouts and mappings?
3. **Data Integration**: How should dr_plotter handle multi-dimensional data preparation?
4. **Styling Control**: How to balance automatic styling with fine-grained control?

## Evidence-Based Approach

Each phase builds on concrete evidence from the previous phase:
- Phase 1 evidence → Phase 2 design decisions  
- Phase 2 friction points → Phase 3 API design
- Phase 3 design → Phase 4 implementation choices
- Phase 4 results → Future enhancement priorities

## Success Metrics

**Immediate**: Working visualization that meets requirements
**Strategic**: Reusable patterns that handle entire classes of similar problems
**Long-term**: Enhanced dr_plotter that makes complex visualizations significantly easier
