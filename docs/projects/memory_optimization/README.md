# Memory Optimization Project

## Project Overview
Working on creating systematic plotting scripts for ML evaluation data using dr_plotter's faceting system, with focus on memory efficiency and context restoration.

## Current Status
- âœ… Faceting system implementation completed
- âœ… Core functionality working and tested
- ðŸ”„ Active work on systematic ML evaluation scripts

## Project Structure

### Active Work
- `memory_compaction_continuation_guide.md` - Current project continuation guide with latest status

### Implementation Phases
- `phases/memory-restoration-guide.md` - Phase 1: Foundation and initial approach
- `phases/memory-restoration-guide-phase2.md` - Phase 2: Advanced techniques  
- `phases/memory-restoration-guide-phase3.md` - Phase 3: Final optimization strategies

## Key Achievement
Successfully implemented dr_plotter's native faceting support with 94/94 faceting tests passing, enabling efficient multi-dimensional data visualization.

## Next Steps
See `memory_compaction_continuation_guide.md` for current project status and next actions.
