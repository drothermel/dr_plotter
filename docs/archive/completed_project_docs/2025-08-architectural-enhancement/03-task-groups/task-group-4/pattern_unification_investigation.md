# Pattern Unification Investigation
## Task Group 4: Evidence Collection for Configuration vs Function Pattern Decisions

### Mission Statement
Systematically investigate current code patterns to establish evidence-based criteria for Decision 5 (Function Decomposition Prioritization) and Decision 6 (Configuration vs Function Pattern Resolution). This investigation will inform the unified approach for Task Group 4 pattern establishment and systematic application.

### Current Status Context
- **Task Groups 1-3 Complete**: Capability architecture, StyleApplicator enforcement, API type coverage
- **Remaining Challenge**: Establish consistent architectural patterns for complex function handling and configuration object usage
- **Strategic Goal**: Define clear boundaries and systematic approaches for maintainable, scalable code organization

### Investigation Objectives

#### Primary Objectives
1. **Document current pattern landscape** across the entire codebase
2. **Identify inconsistencies** and mixed approaches in function complexity and configuration handling  
3. **Establish evidence-based criteria** for configuration vs function boundary decisions
4. **Propose systematic approach** for pattern unification with implementation priorities

#### Secondary Objectives
1. **Quantify complexity metrics** for function decomposition candidates
2. **Analyze configuration pattern effectiveness** across different components
3. **Assess implementation effort** for various pattern unification approaches
4. **Validate alignment** with DR methodology principles

### Required Investigation Areas

#### 1. Function Complexity Analysis (Decision 5)

**Files to analyze systematically:**
- `src/dr_plotter/plotters/base.py` - Core plotting functionality
- `src/dr_plotter/plotters/*.py` - All plotter implementations
- `src/dr_plotter/style_applicator.py` - Style resolution logic
- `src/dr_plotter/figure.py` - Figure management
- `src/dr_plotter/legend_manager.py` - Legend coordination

**Metrics to collect for each function:**
```python
# For each function, document:
- Line count (excluding comments/blank lines)
- Cyclomatic complexity (if-statements, loops, early returns)
- Parameter count
- Nested level depth
- Number of responsibilities (single responsibility principle violations)
- Dependencies on other complex functions
```

**Specific complexity targets mentioned in synthesis:**
- `verify_example` function - mentioned as needing decomposition
- `_resolve_component_styles` function - mentioned as critical path
- Functions >50 lines per synthesis metrics
- Functions >8 branches per synthesis metrics

**Evidence questions:**
- Which functions currently exceed complexity thresholds?
- Which functions have multiple clear responsibilities that could be extracted?
- Which complex functions are blocking type annotation improvements?
- Which functions are critical path for performance or maintainability?

#### 2. Configuration Pattern Analysis (Decision 6)

**Current configuration approaches to document:**

##### **Configuration Object Patterns**
- `GroupingConfig` - visual channel coordination
- `LegendConfig` - legend management configuration  
- `FigureManager` constructor patterns - figure-level settings
- Theme system - styling configuration

##### **Function Parameter Patterns**  
- Constructor parameter handling across plotters
- kwargs processing in API functions
- Style resolution parameter flow
- Validation logic organization

##### **Hybrid Patterns**
- StyleApplicator parameter extraction
- Component schema definitions
- Post-processing coordination
- Error handling and validation

**Analysis framework:**
```python
# For each identified pattern, document:
Pattern Name: [e.g., "Constructor Parameter Consolidation"]
Current Location: [file:line references]
Data Handled: [what information it manages]
Reuse Level: [single use, class-wide, system-wide]
Complexity: [lines, dependencies, responsibilities]
Effectiveness: [clear/unclear boundaries, maintainable/complex]
Alternative Approaches: [what other patterns could handle this]
```

#### 3. Cross-Cutting Concerns Identification

**Systematic categorization of current functionality:**

##### **Clear Cross-Cutting Concerns** (Configuration Object Candidates)
- Parameter handling and validation
- Theme resolution and inheritance
- Visual channel coordination
- Figure layout management
- Error message generation

##### **Clear Algorithmic Concerns** (Function Decomposition Candidates)  
- Style calculation and application
- Data transformation and preprocessing
- Plot positioning and coordinate calculation
- Legend entry creation and deduplication
- Component style resolution algorithms

##### **Hybrid/Unclear Cases** (Need Pattern Decision)
- Grouped plot coordination logic
- Component schema processing
- Post-processing pipeline management
- Style fallback resolution
- Validation logic with complex rules

#### 4. Pattern Boundary Criteria Development

**Develop concrete criteria for configuration vs function decisions:**

##### **Configuration Object Criteria (When to use objects)**
- **Data Lifetime**: Does data persist across multiple method calls?
- **Reuse Pattern**: Is same data structure used in multiple contexts?
- **Complexity**: Does configuration require validation, defaults, or computed properties?
- **Cross-cutting**: Does it affect multiple components or phases?

##### **Function Decomposition Criteria (When to break down functions)**
- **Single Responsibility**: Does function handle multiple distinct concerns?
- **Complexity Thresholds**: Lines >50, branches >8, parameters >6?
- **Testability**: Is function difficult to test due to multiple responsibilities?
- **Type Safety**: Does complexity prevent clear type annotations?

##### **Pattern Decision Matrix**
Create evidence-based matrix for each code pattern:
```
| Pattern | Cross-cutting | Reused | Complex | Recommendation |
|---------|---------------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Example | High          | Yes     | Medium  | Config Object  |
```

### Specific Evidence Collection Tasks

```

## Investigation Success Framework

**The investigation succeeds when it provides:**
1. **Clear implementation approach** for Task Group 4 based on concrete evidence
2. **Unified pattern strategy** that addresses both function complexity and configuration consistency
3. **Actionable recommendations** with specific targets, effort estimates, and success criteria
4. **Decision confidence** through systematic validation against current codebase

This investigation will determine whether Task Group 4 should focus on function decomposition first, configuration pattern establishment first, or a unified approach that addresses both simultaneously. The evidence collected will inform the most effective systematic pattern unification strategy for completing Phase 2 architectural enhancement.

**Ready for systematic investigation**: All requirements defined, methodology established, deliverable criteria clear.
