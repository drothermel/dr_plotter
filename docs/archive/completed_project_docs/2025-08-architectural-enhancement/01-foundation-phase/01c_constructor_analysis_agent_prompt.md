# Agent Task: Constructor Standardization Analysis

## Task Overview
Analyze the proposed constructor standardization design for potential issues, edge cases, or implementation problems before proceeding with changes.

## Proposed Standardized Pattern
```python
def __init__(
    self,
    data: pd.DataFrame,
    grouping_cfg: GroupingConfig, 
    theme: Optional[Theme] = None,
    figure_manager: Optional[Any] = None,
    **kwargs: Any,
) -> None:
```

## Files to Analyze

### Current Status by Plotter:
- **‚úÖ Already compliant**: ContourPlotter, HeatmapPlotter (complex/compound plotters)
- **üîÑ Need upgrade**: ViolinPlotter, BarPlotter, ScatterPlotter, HistogramPlotter (currently `*args, **kwargs`)
- **üîÑ Need addition**: BumpPlotter, LinePlotter (currently no constructor override)

## Analysis Tasks

### 1. Signature Compatibility Analysis
For each plotter that needs changes, verify:
- **Base class compatibility**: Does the proposed signature match the base `BasePlotter.__init__`?
- **Super() call compatibility**: Can `super().__init__(data, grouping_cfg, theme, figure_manager, **kwargs)` work correctly?
- **Parameter passing**: Are there any special parameter handling patterns that might break?

### 2. Specialized Initialization Review
Check each plotter's current `__init__` method for:
- **Additional setup code**: Does any plotter do specialized initialization beyond base setup?
- **Post-processor registration**: How do plotters register their style processors?
- **Custom parameter handling**: Any plotter-specific parameters or logic?

### 3. Edge Case Identification
Look for potential issues:
- **Import dependencies**: Any typing imports needed for the explicit signature?
- **Breaking changes**: Could this change break existing API usage?
- **Inheritance chain**: Any complications with multiple inheritance or mixins?
- **Test compatibility**: Might this break existing test patterns?

### 4. Pattern Consistency Verification
Ensure the design works across plotter categories:
- **Atomic base types** (Violin, Bar, Scatter, Histogram): Simple plotters with minimal setup
- **Complex compound** (Contour, Heatmap): Already working with this pattern
- **Inheriting plotters** (Bump, Line): Currently rely on base implementation

## Success Criteria
- Identify any incompatibilities with base class expectations
- Flag potential breaking changes to existing API usage
