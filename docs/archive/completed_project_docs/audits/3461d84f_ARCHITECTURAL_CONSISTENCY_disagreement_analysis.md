## Consensus Claims (≥75% Agent Agreement)

### **Claim**: All plotters inherit from BasePlotter with consistent patterns
- **Agent Agreement**: 4/4 agents identified this
- **Consistency Level**: Identical descriptions - all agents confirm 8/8 plotters properly inherit from BasePlotter
- **Evidence Needed**: None - this is universally confirmed
- **Priority Indication**: All agents rated this as foundational strength

### **Claim**: StyleApplicator integration is systematic across all plotters  
- **Agent Agreement**: 4/4 agents identified this
- **Consistency Level**: Identical descriptions - all plotters use StyleApplicator → StyleEngine pipeline
- **Evidence Needed**: None - universally confirmed architectural strength
- **Priority Indication**: All agents rated this as excellent systematic design

### **Claim**: Missing legend integration in HeatmapPlotter and ContourPlotter
- **Agent Agreement**: 3/4 agents identified this (Agent1, Agent2, Agent3; Gemini1 silent on this)
- **Consistency Level**: Identical descriptions - both plotters completely lack legend integration
- **Evidence Needed**: File inspection to confirm missing `_apply_post_processing()` methods and legend registration
- **Priority Indication**: All 3 agents rated this as Critical/High priority

### **Claim**: Inconsistent legend registration patterns across plotters
- **Agent Agreement**: 4/4 agents identified this pattern
- **Consistency Level**: Similar descriptions - all note variations in legend entry creation approaches
- **Evidence Needed**: Code comparison of legend registration methods across all plotters
- **Priority Indication**: 3 agents rated Critical/High, 1 agent noted as minor cosmetic improvement

### **Claim**: Component schema variations exist across plotters
- **Agent Agreement**: 3/4 agents identified this (Agent1, Agent2, Agent3; Gemini1 notes schemas as consistent)
- **Consistency Level**: Similar descriptions - different schema structures and attribute names
- **Evidence Needed**: Schema structure comparison across all plotter classes
- **Priority Indication**: Most agents rated this as Medium priority for standardization

### **Claim**: Consistent data preparation patterns across all plotters
- **Agent Agreement**: 4/4 agents identified this
- **Consistency Level**: Identical descriptions - standardized column renaming and melting
- **Evidence Needed**: None - universally confirmed as architectural strength
- **Priority Indication**: All agents rated this as excellent systematic design

### **Claim**: Unified theme integration across all plotters
- **Agent Agreement**: 4/4 agents identified this
- **Consistency Level**: Identical descriptions - proper theme resolution hierarchy
- **Evidence Needed**: None - universally confirmed as architectural strength  
- **Priority Indication**: All agents rated this as excellent systematic design

## Disputed Claims (Agent Disagreement)

### **Claim**: Overall architectural assessment severity
- **Agent Positions**:
  - Agent1: "Good with Critical Issues" - 8 critical issues requiring immediate attention
  - Agent2: "Good with Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention" - 4 critical issues
  - Agent3: "GOOD with Critical Issues" - 3 critical issues requiring immediate action
  - Gemini1: "Excellent" - 0 priority issues, architecture is robust and systematic
- **Disagreement Type**: Severity assessment - agents agree on foundational strength but strongly disagree on issue count and criticality
- **Evidence Needed**: Systematic review of each claimed "critical issue" to determine actual impact and urgency
- **Resolution Path**: Detailed code inspection and impact analysis of each identified issue

### **Claim**: StyleApplicator bypass patterns exist
- **Agent Positions**:
  - Agent1: Claims direct style_engine access in contour.py:87 and heatmap.py:94 bypasses abstraction
  - Agent2: No mention of StyleApplicator bypass issues
  - Agent3: Claims direct theme access with `_get_style()` calls in contour.py:88-100 bypasses StyleApplicator
  - Gemini1: No mention of StyleApplicator bypass issues
- **Disagreement Type**: Existence - 2 agents identify bypass patterns, 2 agents don't mention this issue
- **Evidence Needed**: Code inspection of contour.py and heatmap.py lines 87-100 to verify direct style access patterns
- **Resolution Path**: Line-by-line analysis of style resolution calls to confirm whether abstraction layer is being bypassed

## Novel Claims (Single Agent)

### **Claim**: Missing `_draw_grouped` implementations in line and scatter plotters
- **Source Agent**: Agent1
- **Uniqueness Factor**: Only Agent1 identified this as inconsistent grouping behavior; other agents didn't mention grouped method implementations
- **Evidence Needed**: Code inspection of line.py and scatter.py to verify presence/absence of `_draw_grouped` methods and comparison with bar/violin implementations
- **Potential Impact**: If true, could indicate incomplete grouped plotting support for certain plotter types

### **Claim**: Parameter mapping gaps across most plotters
- **Source Agent**: Agent2  
- **Uniqueness Factor**: Only Agent2 noted that most plotters have empty `param_mapping` dictionaries while BumpPlotter has meaningful mappings
- **Evidence Needed**: Review `param_mapping` declarations across all plotter classes to verify usage patterns
- **Potential Impact**: If true, could indicate inconsistent parameter name translation or unused architectural components

### **Claim**: `_apply_post_processing` method signature variations
- **Source Agent**: Gemini1
- **Uniqueness Factor**: Only Gemini1 noted parameter name variations (patches, lines, collection) as potential standardization opportunity
- **Evidence Needed**: Method signature comparison across all `_apply_post_processing` implementations
- **Potential Impact**: If true, represents minor cosmetic inconsistency rather than functional issue

## Evidence Requirements Summary

### **High Priority Verification**
- Systematic review of claimed "critical issues" to determine actual severity and count discrepancies
- Code inspection of StyleApplicator bypass claims in contour.py:87-100 and heatmap.py:94
- Verification of missing legend integration in HeatmapPlotter and ContourPlotter
- Legend registration pattern comparison across all plotters to quantify inconsistencies

### **Medium Priority Verification**
- Component schema structure analysis across all plotter classes
- `_draw_grouped` method presence verification in line.py and scatter.py  
- Parameter mapping usage patterns across all plotter classes
- Method signature comparison for `_apply_post_processing` implementations

### **Pattern Analysis Required**  
- Comprehensive legend registration pattern audit across all 8 plotters
- Style resolution call pattern analysis to identify any abstraction layer bypasses
- Component schema standardization assessment with specific attribute name mapping

### **Quantitative Analysis Required**
- Count of actual critical issues vs claimed critical issues across all reports
- Percentage of plotters with consistent vs inconsistent patterns for each architectural aspect
- Legend integration coverage statistics (currently claimed as 6/8 or 8/8 depending on agent)
