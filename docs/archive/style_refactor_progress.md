# Style Refactor Progress Report

*Last Updated: 2025-08-23*

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of the comprehensive style refactoring initiative for dr_plotter, addressing inconsistent styling, unclear precedence rules, and complex multi-component plotters.

## Major Achievements

### ✅ Phase 1: Phased Styling System
Implemented a four-phase styling lifecycle that elegantly separates concerns:
- **plot** → Initial matplotlib call with filtered kwargs
- **post** → Modify artists after creation (solves ViolinPlotter color issue)
- **axes** → Axes-level styling (labels, limits, grid)
- **legend** → Legend management and coordination

**Key Innovation**: Post-processing phase allows modification of matplotlib artists after creation, solving API limitations without theme mutation.

### ✅ Phase 2: Legend Management System
Created a hybrid legend management system combining automatic smart defaults with manual control:
- **LegendEntry**: Tracks artist, label, visual channel metadata
- **LegendRegistry**: Collects and deduplicates entries
- **LegendManager**: Coordinates figure-level legends
- **Backward Compatible**: Old Legend class becomes facade

**Key Feature**: Automatic figure-level legends for multi-subplot layouts with deduplication.

### ✅ Phase 3: Component Schema Refactoring
Moved component schemas from centralized dictionary to plotter classes:
- Each plotter defines its own `component_schema` attribute
- StyleApplicator reads schemas from plotter classes
- Supports custom/external plotters
- Maintains backward compatibility for unmigrated plotters

## Migration Status

### Fully Migrated Plotters
These plotters use both `use_style_applicator` and `use_legend_manager`:

| Plotter | Style Applicator | Legend Manager | Component Schema | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| HistogramPlotter | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Simple single-component |
| ScatterPlotter | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | PathCollection handling |
| ViolinPlotter | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Complex multi-component |

### Pending Migration

| Plotter | Priority | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|----------|------------|-------|
| BarPlotter | High | Low | Similar to Histogram |
| LinePlotter | High | Low | Returns Line2D objects |
| HeatmapPlotter | Medium | Medium | Image-based, different pattern |
| ContourPlotter | Medium | High | Multi-component like Violin |
| BumpPlotter | Low | Medium | Inherits from LinePlotter |

## Technical Improvements

### Style Precedence (Clear & Consistent)
```
user kwargs > group styles > plot-specific theme > base theme
```

### Key Patterns Established
1. **Post-processor registration** in plotter `__init__`
2. **Label extraction** before matplotlib calls
3. **Proxy artist creation** for legend entries
4. **Component schema as class attribute**

### Code Quality Enhancements
- Type hints throughout new code
- Clear separation of concerns
- Minimal coupling between components
- Backward compatibility via opt-in flags

## Lessons Learned

1. **GroupingConfig is always required** - Never pass None
2. **Post-processing is powerful** - Elegantly solves matplotlib limitations
3. **Gradual migration works** - Opt-in flags allow incremental adoption
4. **Schemas belong with plotters** - Better cohesion and maintainability

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Migrate BarPlotter and LinePlotter (simple cases)
2. Extract duplicate group label logic in BasePlotter
3. Document migration patterns for team

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Migrate HeatmapPlotter and ContourPlotter
2. Create migration guide for custom plotters
3. Add integration tests for multi-plotter scenarios

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. Complete BumpPlotter migration
2. Deprecate StyleEngine
3. Plan removal of legacy system
4. Performance optimization if needed

## Success Metrics

- ✅ **Zero breaking changes** to existing code
- ✅ **Theme mutation eliminated** (ViolinPlotter fixed)
- ✅ **Clear style precedence** rules implemented
- ✅ **Figure-level legend coordination** working
- ✅ **Extensible architecture** for future enhancements

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `src/dr_plotter/style_applicator.py` - Core phased styling system
- `src/dr_plotter/legend_manager.py` - Legend management components

### Enhanced Files
- `src/dr_plotter/theme.py` - Added PostStyles and legend_config
- `src/dr_plotter/figure.py` - Legend coordination
- `src/dr_plotter/plotters/base.py` - Integration logic

### Migrated Plotters
- `src/dr_plotter/plotters/histogram.py`
- `src/dr_plotter/plotters/scatter.py`
- `src/dr_plotter/plotters/violin.py`

## Conclusion

The style refactor is progressing excellently, with core infrastructure complete and three plotters successfully migrated. The architecture is clean, extensible, and solves all identified pain points while maintaining backward compatibility. The patterns are well-established for completing the remaining migrations.
