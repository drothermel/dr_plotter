# Strategic Report: Faceted Plotting Implementation

## Project Overview
- **Date**: 2025-08-26
- **Project**: Implement systematic support for multi-dimensional faceted plotting in dr_plotter
- **Strategic Goal**: Transform complex multi-dimensional data visualization from brittle one-off solutions to reusable, intuitive patterns
- **Approach**: Evidence-first methodology through systematic phases (Analysis → Example → Design → Implementation)

## Key Decisions & Rationale
### Decision 1: Example-first vs design-first approach
- **Context**: Need to add faceting capabilities to dr_plotter with unknown complexity and friction points
- **Options Considered**: Design API upfront, build example with current tools first, hybrid approach
- **Choice**: Example-first approach - build working visualization using current dr_plotter capabilities first
- **Rationale**: Evidence-based design prevents over-engineering and reveals actual usage patterns and friction points
- **Expected Outcome**: Clear understanding of what should be abstracted vs what should remain user responsibility

### Decision 2: Comprehensive data exploration vs minimal analysis
- **Context**: Unknown data structure and constraints in mean_eval.parquet dataset
- **Choice**: Systematic Phase 1 with complete dimensional analysis and validation
- **Rationale**: Complex faceted plotting decisions depend on data structure understanding; incomplete analysis creates implementation failures
- **Outcome**: 100% data density discovery eliminates subset constraints, null value patterns inform plotting approach

### Decision 3: Specific target visualization vs generic example
- **Context**: Need concrete example to drive systematic library enhancement design
- **Choice**: Exact specification (2×4 grid, pile_valppl/mmlu_avg_correct_prob metrics, 4 specific data recipes)
- **Rationale**: Concrete targets reveal specific friction points; generic examples mask configuration complexity
- **Strategic Value**: Specific implementation patterns generalize to entire class of faceted plotting problems

## What Worked Well
- **Systematic phase decomposition**: 4-phase approach provides clear handoffs and evidence accumulation
- **Agent specialization**: Phase 1 data exploration agent delivered comprehensive analysis beyond expectations
- **Evidence-based validation**: Data structure validation prevented false assumptions about metric names and model size ordering
- **Strategic collaboration**: Human strategic guidance with agent systematic execution optimizes quality and scope

## What Didn't Work / Lessons Learned
- **Assumption validation critical**: Initial metric naming assumptions (pile-valppl vs pile_valppl) required correction from empirical evidence
- **Ordering complexity**: Model size alphabetic sorting (10M, 14M, 150M) vs logical numeric ordering (4M, 6M, 8M...) needs explicit handling
- **Scope boundary unclear**: Natural division between dr_plotter library responsibilities and user code responsibilities requires systematic investigation

## Reusable Patterns
### Pattern 1: Evidence-First Library Enhancement
- **When to use**: Adding complex capabilities to existing libraries with unknown friction points  
- **How to apply**: Phase 1 (data understanding) → Phase 2 (working example) → Phase 3 (API design) → Phase 4 (implementation)
- **Success criteria**: Each phase provides concrete evidence for next phase design decisions

### Pattern 2: Multi-Dimensional Visualization Decomposition
- **Context**: Complex grid layouts with multiple styling dimensions (rows, columns, lines, colors)
- **Implementation**: Systematic separation of data preparation, grid creation, styling coordination, legend management
- **Benefit**: Identifies reusable patterns vs domain-specific configuration

### Pattern 3: Agent-Driven Systematic Analysis
- **Context**: Complex analysis requiring both systematic execution and strategic coordination
- **Approach**: Comprehensive agent prompts with explicit requirements, human strategic oversight and integration
- **Success criteria**: Agents produce systematic, compliant analysis; humans provide context and coordination

## Strategic Insights
- **About library boundaries**: Natural separation between generic plotting infrastructure (grids, styling) and domain-specific logic (data selection, metric interpretation)
- **About complexity management**: Systematic evidence gathering reveals actual complexity vs perceived complexity in API design
- **About faceted plotting**: Multi-dimensional data visualization complexity comes from coordination across dimensions, not individual subplot complexity
- **About development methodology**: Evidence-first approach prevents premature abstractions and ensures library enhancements solve actual usage friction

## Future Applications
- **Similar projects**: Any library enhancement requiring unknown complexity assessment and systematic capability addition
- **Methodology template**: 4-phase evidence-based approach applicable to complex feature development across projects
- **Architectural pattern**: Multi-dimensional visualization coordination applies beyond ML evaluation data to scientific plotting generally

## Success Metrics
- **Phase 1 complete**: Comprehensive data structure understanding with 100% dimensional coverage analysis
- **Phase 2 ready**: Systematic agent prompt with specific target visualization and friction point documentation requirements
- **Process artifacts**: 4 planning documents, 2 agent prompts, 1 working data exploration script
- **Strategic foundation**: Clear evidence-based methodology for subsequent phases

## Key Architectural Questions Identified
1. **Scope Boundary**: How much faceting logic belongs in dr_plotter vs user code?
2. **Configuration Pattern**: Most intuitive approach for specifying grid layouts and dimension mappings?
3. **Data Integration**: Should dr_plotter handle multi-dimensional data preparation?
4. **Styling Control**: Balance between automatic styling and fine-grained control?

## Conclusion
**Key Takeaway**: Evidence-first methodology through systematic phases enables confident library enhancement decisions by revealing actual complexity and usage patterns rather than assumptions.

**Strategic Value**: Reusable 4-phase approach for complex feature development; systematic investigation of multi-dimensional visualization coordination patterns applicable beyond this specific use case.
