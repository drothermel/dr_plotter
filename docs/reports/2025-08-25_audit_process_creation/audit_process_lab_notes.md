# Lab Notebook: 5-Stage Audit Synthesis Pipeline Creation

## Project Info
- **Date**: 2025-08-25
- **Project**: Design and validate evidence-based architectural audit synthesis pipeline
- **Duration**: Full day collaboration session  
- **Status**: Complete

## Results Summary
- **Pipeline stages**: 5-stage process validated end-to-end
- **Agent reports generated**: 25+ audit documents across 5 categories
- **Evidence verification success**: 60%+ strong evidence rate across categories
- **Integration synthesis**: 27 high-priority issues systematically coordinated into 8-week roadmap
- **Process documentation**: Complete prompts, templates, strategic guides

## Code Changes
### File: docs/processes/audit_synthesis_pipeline.md
- **Lines 13-43**: 5-stage process flow documentation with purpose, inputs, outputs
- **Line 39**: Added Stage 4 cross-category integration for unified implementation strategy

### File: docs/processes/prompts/disagreement_identification_prompt.md  
- **Lines 18-20**: Added DR methodology context for agent understanding
- **Lines 25-40**: Systematic consensus/conflict identification methodology

### File: docs/processes/prompts/evidence_verification_prompt.md
- **Lines 30-43**: DR methodology compliance context for evidence evaluation
- **Lines 25-35**: Counter-example investigation mandate for bias prevention

### File: docs/processes/prompts/synthesis_agent_prompt.md
- **Lines 15-20**: Added DR methodology and priority focus guidance
- **Lines 45-60**: Evidence-weighted implementation roadmap structure

### File: docs/processes/prompts/cross_category_synthesis_prompt.md
- **Entire file**: New 200-line comprehensive prompt for Stage 4 integration synthesis

## Bugs Encountered & Fixes
### Bug 1: Agent context requirements unclear
- **Location**: Stage 1-3 prompt deployment
- **Error**: "I need specific category information" responses from agents  
- **Cause**: Prompts assumed context would be provided separately
- **Fix**: Added explicit input requirements sections with file paths and category focus
- **Code**: All prompt files updated with context specification sections

### Bug 2: Evidence verification scope creep
- **Location**: Stage 2 evidence verification deployment
- **Symptoms**: Agents investigating claims beyond disagreement analysis scope
- **Cause**: Insufficient focus guidance on priority verification items
- **Fix**: Added priority focus parameters and High Priority item emphasis
- **Result**: Agents focused on critical disagreements requiring resolution

## Technical Discoveries
- **Agent disagreement patterns**: 3/4 agents often converge, 1 outlier agent provides valuable contrast
- **Evidence verification power**: Systematic code search resolves conflicts definitively (12 try-catch blocks vs 0 claim)
- **Cross-category dependencies**: 4 critical path dependencies identified across architectural domains
- **Pipeline scalability**: Same process works for 1 category or 5 categories with parallel execution
- **Integration complexity**: Cross-category synthesis requires systematic dependency analysis, not simple concatenation

## Ideas & Notes  
- **Performance**: Sequential category processing more thorough than parallel for Stage 1-3
- **Architecture**: 5-stage pipeline could template other multi-agent analytical processes
- **Technical debt**: Manual agent coordination could be automated with proper workflow system
- **Future work**: Pipeline could extend to 8+ architectural categories, other codebases

## Environment Notes
- **Dependencies**: Pipeline requires human orchestration between stages currently
- **Tools**: Claude agent deployment successful across all stages
- **Platform**: Process documentation enables reproducibility across projects

## References
- **Files created**: 6 prompt files, 1 pipeline overview, 25+ audit output documents
- **Key processes**: Stage 1 (disagreement identification), Stage 2 (evidence verification), Stage 3 (final synthesis), Stage 4 (cross-category integration)
- **Output location**: docs/audits/ for all synthesis documents, docs/processes/ for templates
