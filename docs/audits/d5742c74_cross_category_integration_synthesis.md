## Cross-Category Dependency Analysis

### **Critical Path Dependencies**
1. **Dependency**: Try-catch elimination (DR Methodology + Configuration) must precede type system completion
   - **Rationale**: Type annotations on error handling functions require stable exception-free code patterns
   - **Categories Affected**: DR Methodology Compliance, Type System Integrity, Configuration Management
   - **Timeline Impact**: Creates Phase 1 critical path requiring coordinated implementation

2. **Dependency**: Legend registration extraction (DR Methodology + Architectural) must precede legend integration completion
   - **Rationale**: Shared legend registration method needed before implementing missing legend systems
   - **Categories Affected**: DR Methodology Compliance, Architectural Consistency  
   - **Timeline Impact**: Enables parallel implementation in Phase 2 once foundation established

3. **Dependency**: StyleApplicator abstraction enforcement must precede complex function decomposition
   - **Rationale**: Style resolution complexity reduction depends on consistent abstraction patterns
   - **Categories Affected**: Architectural Consistency, Code Quality Metrics, Configuration Management
   - **Timeline Impact**: Phase 2 prerequisite enabling effective complexity reduction

4. **Dependency**: Constructor standardization (Configuration) enables API type completion (Type System)
   - **Rationale**: Consistent constructor signatures required for systematic type coverage
   - **Categories Affected**: Configuration Management, Type System Integrity
   - **Timeline Impact**: Sequential dependency requiring Configuration completion before Type System finalization

### **Synergistic Opportunities**
1. **Synergy**: Comment removal + Function decomposition = Enhanced self-documentation capability
   - **Combined Value**: Eliminating comments while simultaneously improving code structure maximizes DR minimalism benefits
   - **Implementation Strategy**: Coordinate comment removal with function decomposition to replace comments with clear function names
   - **Success Metrics**: Zero comments + <50 line functions with self-descriptive names

2. **Synergy**: StyleApplicator enforcement + Parameter consolidation = Unified configuration architecture
   - **Combined Value**: Consistent parameter handling patterns across style resolution and constructor simplification
   - **Implementation Strategy**: Apply configuration pattern established for FigureManager to StyleApplicator parameter handling
   - **Success Metrics**: Systematic configuration objects throughout architecture

3. **Synergy**: Try-catch elimination + Function decomposition = Comprehensive atomicity implementation
   - **Combined Value**: Both changes enforce single-responsibility principle from different angles (error handling + complexity)
   - **Implementation Strategy**: Apply atomicity principle systematically during both error handling and complexity reduction
   - **Success Metrics**: Assertions + small focused functions throughout codebase

4. **Synergy**: Legend integration + Type system completion = Complete API feature parity
   - **Combined Value**: Full functionality coverage with complete static analysis support
   - **Implementation Strategy**: Implement missing legend features while adding comprehensive type coverage
   - **Success Metrics**: 100% plot type feature support + 100% API type coverage

### **Conflict Resolution**
1. **Conflict**: Function decomposition vs constructor parameter consolidation approaches
   - **Nature of Conflict**: Both address complexity through different patterns (functions vs configuration objects)
   - **Resolution Strategy**: Use configuration objects for cross-cutting concerns (parameters), function decomposition for algorithmic complexity
   - **Alternative Approaches**: Hybrid approach - configuration objects for data transfer, function decomposition for logic

2. **Conflict**: Immediate type coverage vs systematic code restructuring timeline
   - **Nature of Conflict**: Type system fixes can be implemented immediately but benefit from code structure improvements first
   - **Resolution Strategy**: Implement critical type fixes (incorrect annotations) immediately, defer comprehensive coverage until structure stabilized
   - **Alternative Approaches**: Parallel implementation with coordination checkpoints

The integrated implementation strategy transforms 5 independent architectural improvement roadmaps into a cohesive, optimized path forward that maximizes value while minimizing risk across all dimensions of the dr_plotter architecture. The systematic approach ensures that each change builds upon previous improvements, creating compound benefits that strengthen the entire architectural foundation while maintaining the research-focused design philosophy that defines the project.
