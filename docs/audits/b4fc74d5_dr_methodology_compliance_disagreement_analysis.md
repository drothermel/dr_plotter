## Consensus Claims (≥75% Agent Agreement)

### **Claim**: Try-catch blocks violate fail-fast principle
- **Agent Agreement**: 3/4 agents identified this (Agent1, Agent2, Agent3)
- **Consistency Level**: Identical descriptions with specific file locations
- **Evidence Needed**: Count and location verification of try-catch blocks in base.py:158-166, violin.py:133-169, scripting files
- **Priority Indication**: All 3 agents rated this as Critical

### **Claim**: Legend registration code duplication across plotters
- **Agent Agreement**: 4/4 agents identified this
- **Consistency Level**: Identical pattern identification across 6+ plotter files
- **Evidence Needed**: Verification of exact pattern matches in violin.py:124-125, bar.py:90-91, scatter.py:123-124, etc.
- **Priority Indication**: All agents rated this as High priority

### **Claim**: Extensive use of assertions for validation is good DR practice
- **Agent Agreement**: 4/4 agents identified this as strength
- **Consistency Level**: Similar positive assessment with specific examples
- **Evidence Needed**: Count of assertion usage vs exception handling patterns
- **Priority Indication**: All agents rated this as strength to maintain

### **Claim**: Complex function _render_with_grouped_method violates atomicity
- **Agent Agreement**: 3/4 agents identified this (Agent1, Agent2, Agent3)
- **Consistency Level**: Similar assessment of 50+ line multi-responsibility function
- **Evidence Needed**: Function complexity analysis and responsibility count verification
- **Priority Indication**: Agents rated this as Medium to High priority

### **Claim**: Good atomicity in most functions demonstrates DR compliance
- **Agent Agreement**: 4/4 agents identified this as strength
- **Consistency Level**: Similar positive assessment with metrics
- **Evidence Needed**: Function length analysis and single responsibility verification
- **Priority Indication**: All agents noted this as foundational strength

### **Claim**: Strong type annotation culture throughout codebase
- **Agent Agreement**: 4/4 agents identified this as strength
- **Consistency Level**: Identical positive assessment
- **Evidence Needed**: Type annotation coverage percentage verification
- **Priority Indication**: All agents noted as important maintained strength

### **Claim**: Clean file organization following conceptual mapping
- **Agent Agreement**: 4/4 agents identified this as strength
- **Consistency Level**: Similar positive assessment of structure
- **Evidence Needed**: File organization review against conceptual model
- **Priority Indication**: All agents noted as architectural strength

### **Claim**: Code duplication beyond legend registration (styling patterns, magic numbers)
- **Agent Agreement**: 3/4 agents identified this (Agent1, Agent2, Agent3)
- **Consistency Level**: Similar identification of repeated patterns
- **Evidence Needed**: Comprehensive duplication analysis across all pattern types
- **Priority Indication**: Agents rated this as Medium priority

## Disputed Claims (Agent Disagreement)

### **Claim**: Overall assessment of DR methodology compliance
- **Agent Positions**:
  - Agent1: "Needs Improvement" - Critical violations exist
  - Agent2: "Needs Improvement with Critical Methodology Violations"  
  - Agent3: "NEEDS IMPROVEMENT with Critical Violations"
  - Gemini1: "Excellent" - Outstanding adherence, model implementation
- **Disagreement Type**: Assessment severity - 3 agents see critical violations, 1 agent sees excellent compliance
- **Evidence Needed**: Systematic review of all identified issues to determine if they constitute critical violations or acceptable patterns
- **Resolution Path**: Code inspection to verify existence and severity of reported try-catch blocks, duplication patterns, and defensive programming

### **Claim**: Existence and severity of defensive programming patterns
- **Agent Positions**:
  - Agent1: "15+ try-catch blocks violating fail-fast principle"
  - Agent2: "15+ try-catch blocks with silent failures"
  - Agent3: "15 try-catch blocks for validation, bare except clauses"
  - Gemini1: "0 try-catch blocks found, no defensive programming"
- **Disagreement Type**: Existence - 3 agents report extensive try-catch usage, 1 agent reports zero instances
- **Evidence Needed**: Complete codebase scan for try-catch blocks with specific file:line references
- **Resolution Path**: Automated search for try-catch patterns to determine actual count and locations

## Novel Claims (Single Agent)

### **Claim**: Comments violating zero-comment policy (67 comments across 24 files)
- **Source Agent**: Agent2
- **Uniqueness Factor**: Other agents focused on code structure violations but didn't audit comment compliance
- **Evidence Needed**: Complete comment audit across all files to verify count and locations
- **Potential Impact**: If true, represents significant violation of DR methodology's self-documenting code principle

## Evidence Requirements Summary

### **High Priority Verification**
- Comprehensive try-catch block audit with exact locations and types
- Legend registration pattern verification across all plotter files
- Overall compliance assessment reconciliation between conflicting agent evaluations

### **Medium Priority Verification**  
- Comment count and location verification for zero-comment policy compliance
- Function complexity analysis for _render_with_grouped_method atomicity assessment
- Magic number and styling pattern duplication analysis

### **Pattern Analysis Required**
- Assertion vs exception usage patterns across entire codebase
- Code duplication patterns beyond legend registration
- Defensive programming pattern identification and classification

### **Quantitative Analysis Required**
- Try-catch block count with categorization (defensive vs legitimate)
- Function length distribution and atomicity scoring
- Type annotation coverage percentage
- Comment count and distribution across files
